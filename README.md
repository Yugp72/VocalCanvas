# VocalCanvas - Android Interview Project

A non-linear, interactive Android application that demonstrates innovative UI/UX design and modern Android architecture patterns. Built specifically to showcase technical skills for Android development positions, particularly at companies like Robinhood that value innovative UI/UX and a "builder" mentality.

## 🎯 Project Overview

VocalCanvas breaks away from traditional linear chat interfaces by presenting messages in a **2D draggable canvas** where users can spatially arrange and interact with financial data and AI responses. This demonstrates:

- **Innovative UI/UX**: Non-linear, interactive canvas instead of standard vertical lists
- **Modern Android Architecture**: MVVM with clean separation of concerns
- **Production-Ready Tech Stack**: Dagger 2, RxJava 2, Retrofit, Room
- **Reactive Programming**: Real-time data streaming with RxJava
- **Offline Support**: Local caching with Room database
